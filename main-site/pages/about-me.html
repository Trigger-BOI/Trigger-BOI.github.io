        Hi, <br><br>
        My name is TRGR. This is my personal website where I can do wathever I want. I am a 22-years-old guy with a bachelor in Graphic design, with a passion for music and some coding as well. <br><br>

        I got my bachelor last year at <a href="https://www.luca-arts.be/nl/grafisch-ontwerp-campus-gent-sint-lucas-bachelor">LUCA School of Arts Ghent.</a> <br>
        Now doing a bachelor Computer Science at <a href="https://www.hogent.be/opleidingen/bachelors/toegepaste-informatica/">HoGent</a>. <br><br>

        I want to make this website a place where I can share my projects and ideas. I am still working on it, so it is not finished yet. For now you can find some of the notes I want to share in the <i>*TRGR-Notes.exe*</i> page. There is not a whole lot but it will fill over time. <br><br>
        For now, enjoy what is here! <br><br>

        â€” T.R.G.R.
