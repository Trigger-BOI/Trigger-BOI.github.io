<h1>The Highest Form of Love</h1>
<p>I don't believe that love for a person is the highest form of love. I think there is something even greater, something much more important: the love for absolute beauty in everything and everyone. Love for a person comes with no guarantees. My partner could leave, pass away, or the love could simply fade. The beauty in things and people, however, is endless. There will always be beauty, and this is what we should truly pursue. Still, I believe that love for a person, like a girlfriend or wife, holds significant value. For absolute happiness, I think there needs to be a combination of both. The love for beauty is a less intense but constant form of love once you recognize it, while love for a person is a much more intense love. This is the love you feel the most strongly, but it often fluctuates.</p>
<p>The only downside is that beauty will never give back. It physically cannot, and you know this from the start. With love for a person, itâ€™s enjoyable to go through things together. You want to learn to live together, which requires being able to get along and become one. This is something beauty can never provide. For the rest of existence, this is a one-sided love; you will never be able to become one with beauty, which means it cannot lead to pure happiness on its own.</p>
<p>Therefore, a combination of the two is needed.</p>
