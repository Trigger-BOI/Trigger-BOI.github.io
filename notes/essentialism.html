<h1>Essentialism</h1>
<p>Learn to say no. Donâ€™t buy something just because you want it. Buy something because you are gonna use it. Only say yes to tasks if they align with you skill and what you want to learn/become. Focus on tasks that help you grow and not just for the sake of doing tasks.</p>
