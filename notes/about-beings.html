<h1>About Beings</h1>
<p>What is a being? Something that is alive.</p>
<p>Within that, we can still make a distinction. We have conscious beings and unconscious beings. An unconscious being, like a tree, exists and acts without the ability to question its own existence. It simply does what it can and must do. They have their function from the moment they come into existence.</p>
<p>Because we are fully aware of where we are and what we are, we can set our own goals. We are aware of what we are and therefore want to connect it to a sense of who we are. We are conscious of our thoughts and can engage in discussions with them. But because of this, we need to search for our purpose. We donâ€™t know this from the moment we exist. As a result, we often believe that we need a purpose throughout our lives, and we can quickly feel empty or lonely if we don't find one.</p>
