<h1> The size of the ego</h1>

<p> A big ego = irrational self-confidence or irrational self-doubt.</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as too small an ego? It depends on the person. It can lead to a lack of self-love.</p>
<p>Is being ego-less a good thing? I don't think so. Why would you keep living if you are nothing anymore? You need to gain control over your ego</p>
<p>Saying that you have a small ego is a sign of a big ego.</p>
<p>Being humble is a sign of a small ego.</p>
<p>What does it mean to gain control over it? </p>
