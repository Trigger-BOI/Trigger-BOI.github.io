                    This <strong>16-minute-long ambient</strong> track aims to represent a never-ending journey. A journey is shaped not only by the planning that goes into it but also by the space left for improvisation in the moment—the wrong turn that leads you down an unexpected path or the wrong bus that shows you a neighborhood you wouldn’t have seen otherwise.<br><br>
                    It’s ambient, not in the sense of fading into the background while you focus on something else, but in the way it demands your attention by evoking emotions and letting your mind wander. <br><br>
                    I sought to capture this with a simple yet powerful soundscape of pads and bass, leaving enough open space to reflect the planning stage of a journey. The lead, created with my Korg Volca Modular, fills that space, representing the unplanned or unforeseen moments. The lead was entirely improvised. Rather than perfecting and looping a sound repeatedly as I used to, I let go and just played, moving forward even when I made mistakes. Those mistakes, like detours in a journey, made it imperfect but allowed for experiences I wouldn’t have had otherwise—a sense of surrendering control. <br><br>
                    While you can listen to this track while doing other tasks, I highly recommend taking the time to listen to it at least once with no distractions, allowing your mind to wander freely. <br><br>
                    I hope this track resonates with you as deeply as it does with me. <br><br>
