                    This 16 minute long ambient track tries to represent a never ending journey.<br>
                    What makes a journey, is the planning beforehand but also the space you keep for improvisation in the moment. The wrong turn you made that puts you on an unplanned path or the wrong bus that lets you see a neighbourhood you otherwise wouldn’t have seen.<br><br>
                    It is ambient, not in the sense of disappearing in the background to focus on something else, but actively demanding attention by awakening emotions and letting the mind wander.<br><br>
                    I tried to accomplish this by starting with a simple but strong soundscape of pads and bass, whilst leaven enough open space. This represents the planning you do beforehand. The lead that fills the open  space is made with my Korg Volca Modular, which represents the unplanned or unforeseen parts of the journey. Theo lead was completely improvised. Instead of creating a loop, perfecting it and repeating it over and over again like I used to do, I let go and just played something and kept going. Even when I made a mistake. The mistakes, just like in the journey, is what makes it imperfect, but allows you to do things you would otherwise never have done. A feeling of letting control go in some way.<br><br>
                    You can listen to this whilst doing some other task, but I highly recommend to at least ones listen to this when doing nothing else and let the mind go it’s own way.<br><br>
                    I hope this will be as effective for you as it is for me.
                    </p>
